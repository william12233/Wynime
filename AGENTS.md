# Wynime Agent Instructions

Before changing code, read in this order:

1. `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. Relevant feature docs and tests

## Working rules

- Do not implement magnet, BT, seeding, DRM bypass, paywall bypass, or access-control circumvention.
- Preserve the approved architecture: Flutter UI with platform-native media and WebView integrations.
- Playback and download must share the same `PlaybackSession`.
- Ad removal must use one authoritative `AdRemovalPlan` keyed by source, line, episode, and manifest fingerprint.
- Download and deletion must share one authoritative `DownloadArtifactManifest`; deletion must never reconstruct or guess paths.
- Unsigned source packages are allowed, but sandboxing, domain allowlists, declared permissions, and resource limits are mandatory.
- Do not claim success without running the relevant build, analyze, unit, integration, or golden tests.
- Keep Android and Windows UI visually aligned through shared design tokens and fixed-size screenshot tests.
- Do not add bundled font files until the multilingual font review is explicitly approved.
- Keep telemetry disabled by default and redact secrets, cookies, tokens, and full media URLs from logs.

## Change boundaries

- One phase or one narrowly scoped feature per PR.
- Do not silently expand scope.
- Architecture changes require updating `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Public interfaces require tests before implementation dependencies are added.
- Platform-specific code must stay behind typed interfaces.
