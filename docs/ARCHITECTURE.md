# Wynime Architecture

## Layers

### Presentation
Flutter widgets, responsive shells, navigation, localization, player controls, source management, downloads, library and settings.

### Application
Use cases and coordinators. This layer owns source selection, playback session lifecycle, failover decisions, download orchestration, Bangumi sync orchestration and settings policy.

### Domain
Pure models and interfaces. No Flutter widgets, WebView, Media3, mpv, FFmpeg, HTTP client or database implementation details.

### Infrastructure
Database, network clients, source engines, HLS processing, download implementation, Bangumi client and platform bridges.

### Platform
Android Kotlin modules and Windows native modules. Platform implementations must be hidden behind typed interfaces.

## Authoritative objects

- `PlaybackSession`: single handoff object for players and downloader.
- `AdRemovalPlan`: single ad decision and timeline mapping for a particular manifest fingerprint.
- `DownloadArtifactManifest`: single inventory for every file created by a download task.
- `DeleteJob`: persistent deletion transaction referencing the original artifact manifest.

## Dependency direction

```text
Presentation → Application → Domain
Infrastructure ─────────────→ Domain
Platform ───────────────────→ Domain
```

Domain must not import upper or outer layers.

## Platform strategy

- Flutter owns shared UI and presentation state.
- Android playback starts with Media3; libmpv is a compatibility fallback.
- Windows playback starts with libmpv.
- Android dynamic page resolution uses Android WebView.
- Windows dynamic page resolution uses WebView2.
- The HLS sanitizer and local proxy sit before every playback backend.

## Source strategy

1. CMS fingerprint and generated rules.
2. Declarative selector rules.
3. WebView interception.
4. Site-specific adapter.

A source is not trusted merely because it is signed. Every source is constrained by permissions, domain allowlists and resource budgets.

## Failure policy

- HTTP authorization failures refresh the session.
- Manifest failures go through sanitizer diagnostics.
- Codec or renderer failures may trigger backend fallback.
- Deletion failures remain visible and recoverable.
- No layer may convert an unknown failure into success.
